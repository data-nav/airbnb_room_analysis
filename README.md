This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listings in New York, focusing on room types, pricing, and review data. The project leverages Python's data manipulation and visualization capabilities to extract actionable insights for the real estate market.

## **Project Overview**

As a consultant for a real estate startup, I have conducted an in-depth analysis of the short-term rental market in New York using data from Airbnb. This project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and insightful visualizations aimed at informing strategic decisions in the real estate domain.

## **Key Features**
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Efficiently handled multiple data formats (CSV, Excel, TSV) to merge datasets and clean the data for analysis.
- **Date Analysis:** Extracted key dates from the review data to identify trends in listing activity.
- **Room Type Distribution:** Analyzed the distribution of room types (private, shared, entire homes) to understand market preferences.
- **Pricing Analysis:** Computed and visualized average listing prices to assess affordability across neighborhoods.
- **Visualization:** Created compelling visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate findings effectively.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python:** Primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas:** For efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating detailed and insightful visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** To document and execute code interactively.
- **Git & GitHub:** Version control and repository hosting.

## **Data Sources**
The analysis is based on three datasets:
1. **airbnb_price.csv:** Contains pricing and location data for each listing.
2. **airbnb_room_type.xlsx:** Provides descriptions and room type classifications.
3. **airbnb_last_review.tsv:** Includes host information and the last review dates.

## **Analysis Summary**
The analysis revealed significant insights into New Yorkâ€™s Airbnb market, such as:
- **Price Variations:** The average listing price fluctuates significantly across different neighborhoods, with premium areas demanding higher prices.
- **Room Type Preferences:** Private rooms are the most common type, reflecting a trend toward cost-effective accommodation options.
- **Review Patterns:** Listings with more frequent reviews tend to maintain higher visibility and occupancy rates.
